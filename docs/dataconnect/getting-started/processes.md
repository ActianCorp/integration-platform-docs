# Processes

A process provides a seamless, directed workflow consisting of individual steps that are configured and linked in order of execution. Steps (in conjunction with components) are the building blocks of a process. The steps can be combined to perform a wide-array of tasks and determine the flow. Before building a new process, consider your data integration objectives. You must have a general idea of the logical steps that are required to reach your goal, including the applications, scripts, or transformations you need, and the decisions that must be done during process execution.
