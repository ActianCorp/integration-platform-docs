# Integration Toolset

## Workspaces and Projects

Workspaces serve as repositories for storing and managing Actian DataConnect projects and their associated content. Projects contain artifacts created within Actian DataConnect (maps, processes, schemas, package inventories, EZscript files, and so on) and general files. To efficiently organize your collaterals, multiple projects can be defined within a workspace, and multiple sub-folders can be created within each project. The contents of the current workspace and projects are displayed in the Project Explorer.

## Maps

The Map Editor enables you to define source and target connections to the required files, tables or entities, manipulate and process the source data using the event model and scripting language, and then write the data to the specified target(s). The user interface for the Map Editor has four distinct tabs (Source, Target, Mapping, and Configuration). You can connect to various sources and targets within the UI, then save and reuse these connections in other maps. For more information about maps, see Designing and Executing Map.
