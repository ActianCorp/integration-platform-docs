# Cortex Web UI

You can manage both local and cloud Cortex deployments through the Web UI.

If you've set up a deployment locally with the Cortex [Quickstart](./quickstart/),
navigate to http://localhost:6333/dashboard.

If you've set up a deployment in a cloud cluster, find your Cluster URL in your
cloud dashboard, at https://cloud.cortex.io. Add `:6333/dashboard` to the end
of the URL. 

## Access the Web UI

Cortex's Web UI is an intuitive and efficient graphic interface for your Cortex Collections, REST API and data points.

In the **Console**, you may use the REST API to interact with Cortex, while in **Collections**, you can manage all the collections and upload Snapshots.

### Cortex Web UI features

In the Cortex Web UI, you can:

- Run HTTP-based calls from the console
- List and search existing [collections](./collections)
- Learn from our interactive tutorial

You can navigate to these options directly. For example, if you used our 
[quick start](./quickstart) to set up a cluster on localhost,
you can review our tutorial at http://localhost:6333/dashboard#/tutorial.
