# Integration Agent Overview

DataCloud Agent Technology enables centralized cloud management of on-premise integration jobs and related collateral. It allows secure cloud-to-on-premises communication without special firewall rules or VPN requirements.

## Why Use An Agent?

The following scenarios are candidates for executing an integration with an Agent:

* Database connections that require drivers (such as ODBC) or connections on an internal network
* Web-based services that are housed internally and are not externally available
* Using source or target files that are located on an internal network

You can set specific configurations to execute using an agent instead of executing in the cloud. This provides access to files and databases from the system running the agent.

Executing configurations using an agent is useful, for example, if you want to obtain test results before executing it in the cloud.

Non-administrators can use one agent at a time.

To use an agent you must Download an Agent, Install an Agent and Register an Agent.
