JG Feedback - This also confused me. The only way I could link a configuration to template was by editing the template after a configuration was created. When creating a configuration from a template, there was no option to use the current template package. Not sure if this is a bug or desired functionality. Need Garrett or Jason to confirm.

6. Click **Create**. 
   
   A configuration is created based on the specified information. The **Configuration Details** page is displayed for the new configuration. See [Editing Configuration Details](../configurations/editing-configuration-details).
