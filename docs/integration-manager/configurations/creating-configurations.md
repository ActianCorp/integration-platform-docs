   ![](/img/Create-Configuration2.png)
3.  On the **Configuration Details** page, click <img src="/img/icons/edit-icon.png" className="icon" alt="the Edit icon"/> to the right of **Package Uploaded**:
   
    ![](/img/Create-Configuration3.png)
4. In the **Upload Packages & Files** dialog, do one of the following:
    
    * Drag and drop a file, or click **BROWSE FILES** to select a file.
    * Select a package and click **DONE**. **Note:** Any configuration files uploaded to the configuration will be listed in the **Select an existing package** dropdown. See [Managing Configuration Files](./managing-configuration-files).

## Creating a Configuration from a Template

Using templates makes it easier to manage multiple configurations. You can create a configuration from the **Template Details** page. Refer to [Creating a Configuration from a Template](../templates/creating-a-configuration-from-a-template).

## Duplicating Configurations

If you need a new configuration that is very similar to an existing configuration, consider duplicating a configuration and revising it rather than creating one from scratch. See [Duplicating Configurations](./duplicating-configurations).
