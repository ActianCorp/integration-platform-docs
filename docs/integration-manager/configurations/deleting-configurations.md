# Deleting Configurations

You can delete an existing configuration from several different pages.

:::info[note]
You cannot delete a configuration if there is an alias (listener) associated with it. You must first delete the listener (which requires Admin privileges). See [Deleting a Listener](../admin/access-control/jobconfig-aliasing#deleting-a-listener).
