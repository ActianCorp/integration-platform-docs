# Duplicating Configurations

If you need an integration that is very similar to an existing integration, consider duplicating the existing integration and revising it, rather than creating one from scratch.

You can duplicate an existing configuration from several different pages.

## From the Configurations Page

## From the Configuration Details Page

## From the Template Configurations Page
