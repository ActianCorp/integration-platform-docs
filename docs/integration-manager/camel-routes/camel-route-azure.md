# Camel Route Configuration for Azure Blob Storage

## Overview

Monitor an Azure Blob Container folder for new files and submit to the JobConfig run API.

## Route Configuration

**routes-prototype.xml**

`(ProgramDataDirectory)/Actian/FileFolderListener/conf/routes-prototype.xml`

:::note
Multiple routes (i.e. for AWS,Azure, GCP and Local) can be added into a single `routes-prototype.xml`.
:::

Example:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<routes xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring">    
    <route id="run-jobconfig-with-azure-blob" autoStartup="false">

        <setProperty name="filenameOverride">
            <constant>input.txt</constant>
        </setProperty>
        <from uri="azure-storage-blob://azure-storage-account-name/azureStorageContainerName?credentialType=SHARED_ACCOUNT_KEY&amp;accessKey={{azure.blob.accesskey}}&amp;backoffMultiplier=6&amp;backoffErrorThreshold=5&amp;backoffIdleThreshold=5"/>

## Properties

| Property | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `route id` | A unique identifier for the route configuration. |  |
| `autoStartup` | Prevents Camel starting the routes on startup. | `false` |
| `jobConfigId` | The job configuration Id in your Integration Manager. The jobConfigId in the above example is configured above with the constant value 102712 (```<constant>102712</constant>```) |  |
| `filenameOverride` | The name of the file you want to override i.e. (```<constant>input.txt</constant>```). The constant value is `input.txt`. |
| `azure-storage-account-name1` | The name of your storage account. This ```azure-storage-account-name1``` example is a sample value and must be replaced with your storage account name. |  |
| `azureStorageContainerName` | The name of your storage container. This ```azureStorageContainerName``` is a sample value and must be replaced with your storage container name. |  |
| `credentialType` | Determines the credential strategy to adopt. | `AZURE_IDENTITY` |
| `accessKey` | Access key for the associated azure account name to be used for authentication with azure blob services. In the above example, ```azure.blob.accesskey``` is the placeholder for accesskey value. |  |
| `backoffMultiplier` | Allows the scheduled polling consumer to back off if there has been a number of subsequent idles/errors in a row. The multiplier is then the number of polls that will be skipped before the next actual attempt is made again. When this option is in use, `backoffIdleThreshold` and/or `backoffErrorThreshold` must also be configured. |  |
| `backoffErrorThreshold` |  The number of subsequent error polls (failed due to some error) that should happen before the `backoffMultipler` should kick in. |  |
| `backoffIdleThreshold` | The number of subsequent idle polls that should happen before the backoffMultipler should kick in. |  |
| `process ref` | A unique identifier for the error handler process. |  |
| `recursive` | If a directory, will look for files in all the sub-directories as well. | `false` |
| `filterFile` | Filters the file based on Simple language. For example, to filter on file size, you can use a ```$\{file:size}``` of `5000`. In the above example, filterFile is configured with file that was modified over 14 days ago (i.e., ```${file:modified} &lt; ${date:now-14d}``` ). |  |
| `level` | Logging level to use. In the above example, the log endpoint is configured to trash. | `INFO` |
